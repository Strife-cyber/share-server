In the server part we realise each client must connect so this is what we do
when a client connects to the server he immediately sends data of his id if it
is empty we generate one for him and send it back thus breaking
the complexity of heartbeat

All right hear me out here. We will change the way we view heartbeat the client
does not need to send his heartbeat but when the server want to send data he sends
a heartbeat message those who do not reply are automatically removed from the list
and this can also be done every timeout seconds
